= DeepTest

DeepTest enables tests to run in parallel using multiple processes.

== Usage

In your Rakefile:

  require "rubygems"
  require "deep_test/rake_tasks"
  
  # sample DeepTest task

  DeepTest::TestTask.new "task_name" do |t|
    t.number_of_workers = 2   # optional, defaults to 2
    t.timeout_in_seconds = 30 # optional, defaults to 30
    t.pattern = "test/**/*_test.rb"
  end

  # Sample SpecTask using DeepTest

  Spec::Rake::SpecTask.new(:deep_spec) do |t|
    t.spec_files = FileList['spec/**/*_spec.rb']
    t.deep_test :number_of_workers => 2,   # optional, defaults to 2
                :timeout_in_seconds => 30, # optional, defaults to 30
  end


If you want to specify a listener to be notified of worker events:

In my_worker_listener.rb
  class MyWorkerListener
    def starting(worker)
    end

    def starting_work(worker, work_unit)
    end

    def finished_work(worker, work_unit, result)
    end
  end

In your Rakefile

  DeepTest::TestTask.new "task_name" do |t|
    t.pattern = "test/**/*_test.rb"
    t.worker_listener = "MyWorkerListener"
  end

An instance of MyWorkerListener will be created for each worker that is
started, and will receive events from that worker.  However, you must ensure
that the MyWorkerListener class is loaded at the time that the test files are
loaded, so it is available to be instantiated.
